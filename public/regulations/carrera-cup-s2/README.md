## 3 Pre-Qualifying
Multiple 3 hour sessions will be hosted throughout the week starting March 1st 2021. Drivers are allowed to attend as many sessions as they like. However, to ensure that drivers who have not participated yet will be able to get a slot, you're not allowed to join a session during practice when you have already participated in a previous session. Each driver must complete a stint of at least five consecutive clean valid laps. The fastest five consecutive laps will serve as their time to be assesed by.

The organisation reserves the right to enter drivers into the championship without them having to qualify. E.g. the top 5 drivers from last season receive automatic entry should they want to participate.

### 3.2 Classes
Drivers will be entered into the PRO or AM class based on their fastest five consecutive clean laps done in pre-qualifying. However, stewards reserve the right to ignore the laptimes and place a driver in a different class when there exists a suspicion that a driver did not perform up to their normal standards.

Drivers who finished in the overall top 5 of previous season will automatically be entered into the PRO class.

## 4. Championship Points
Championship points are only awarded to drivers participating in either the consolation or the feature race.

### 4.2 Bonus Points
- Fastest Lap: In every heat race, consolation race and feature race, a driver can earn 1 bonus point for the fastest lap

### 4.3 Class championships
All drivers score overall points as listed above. The class standings are simply a filter on the overall standings, in which only the PRO or AM class is shown.

### 4.4 Teams Championship
- There will be no prizes awarded for the winning team, this championship is for merit only
- Teams have no drop rounds, all points from all team members count towards the team total.
- Each team can have a maximum of 2 drivers and 1 reserve driver. Only 2 drivers can participate each round. Teams consisting of a single driver are also allowed.

## 5. Attendance
To prevent the field being smaller than expected an attendance form will be used for each round. Every driver (including reserve drivers) should reply to this attendance form, indicating whether or not they will participate in the upcoming round. Failure to respond to the attendance form will result in the driver being moved to the top of the reserve list (in the case of a full season entry) or to the bottom of the reserve list (if the driver was already on the reserve list). Full season entries are only allowed to participate in the round if they responded 'Yes'. For any full season entry responding 'No' a reserve driver who responded 'Yes' will be allowed to drive in the round in question. Responding 'No' means you will not be allowed to race in the round in question. Responding 'Yes' and subsequently being unavailable will have the same result as not responding.

## 6. Protests and Sporting Code
As there is a prize pool, it’s very important that we have clean and fair racing in the championship.

### 6.1 Sporting Rules
- Avoid car contact where possible. All contact incidents involving a car leaving the race track will be reviewed by race stewards either during the event or if missed, afterwards.
 - In the event that the stewards miss the incident, a protest form will be available through the league discord and it will be assessed after the event
- Intentional excessive car contact will have a zero tolerance policy. Incidents such as this will result in disqualification from the race and in the most serious circumstances, disqualification from the championship. 
- As previously mentioned, the protest form will be made available through the discord
 - Protests must be made before the Tuesday after the event at 12:00 UTC
 - Please provide as much information as you can so the stewards can correctly identify the incident (Lap number, corner) 
- In the case that a protest occurs, the stewards will attempt to speak to both drivers before finalising their decision. Full explanations will be given in writing over discord.
- It is completely at the stewards discretion what penalty is applied, please respect the decision. Appealing a decision is not possible.
- The following incident limit will be in place for this series
 - First penalty at 20 incident points
 - Penalty every 5 incident points after 20

### 6.2 Qualifying
During qualifying sessions we expect all drivers to drive a normal outlap without exploiting any unrealistic tricks available in iRacing. This includes, but is not limited to, the 'brake dragging' method.

### 6.3 Connection quality
All races will be hosted on iRacing servers in Germany. All drivers are responsible for their own connection. Connection issues resulting in dangerous situations on track can lead to a driver being disqualified from the session without warning.

### 6.4 Possible Penalties

</table>

Should a driver reach a total of 5 incident points, they will be banned from qualifying in the next round they attend. Every attended round in which a driver does not receive any penalty points, 1 penalty point will be deducted from their total until it reaches 0.

Note that the list above is not exhaustive, it is fully at the discretion of the stewards what penalty is applied.
