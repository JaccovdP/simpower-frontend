- Teams have no drop rounds, all points from all team members count towards the team total.
- Each team can only consist of 2 drivers and 1 reserve driver. Only 2 drivers can participate each round.

## 5. Protests and Sporting Code
As there is a prize pool, it’s very important that we have clean and fair racing in the championship.

### 5.1 Sporting Rules
- Avoid car contact where possible. All contact incidents involving a car leaving the race track will be reviewed by race stewards either during the event or if missed, afterwards.
 - In the event that the stewards miss the incident, a protest form will be available through the league discord and it will be assessed after the event
- Intentional excessive car contact will have a zero tolerance policy. Incidents such as this will result in disqualification from the race and in the most serious circumstances, disqualification from the championship. 
- As previously mentioned, the protest form will be made available through the discord
 - Protests must be made before the Tuesday after the event at 12:00 UTC
 - Please provide as much information as you can so the stewards can correctly identify the incident (Lap number, corner) 
- In the case that a protest occurs, the stewards will attempt to speak to both drivers before finalising their decision. Full explanations will be given in writing over discord.
- It is completely at the stewards discretion what penalty is applied, please respect the decision
- The following incident limit will be in place for this series
 - First penalty at 20 incident points
 - Penalty every 5 incident points after 20
- If you enter the session with the incorrect car then you will be disqualified from the race

### 5.2 Connection quality
All races will be hosted on iRacing servers in Germany. All drivers are responsible for their own connection. Connection issues resulting in dangerous situations on track can lead to a driver being disqualified from the session without warning.

### 5.3 Possible Penalties
TBD
