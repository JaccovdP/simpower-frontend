        *   If this isn't the case when the series starts then we will assign the two drivers with the most points after round 1

## 6. Protests and Sporting Code

As there is a prize pool, it’s very important that we have clean and fair racing in the championship.


### 6.1 Sporting Rules



*   We will be checking for any deliberate iRating sandbagging or the use of a second account to game the system. If this is found to be deliberate, you won't be allowed to compete in the championship.
*   Avoid car contact. All incidents involving car contact will be reviewed by race stewards either during the event or if missed, afterwards.
    *   In the event that the stewards miss the incident, a protest form will be available through the league discord and it will be assessed after the event
*   Intentional car contact will have a zero tolerance policy. Incidents such as this will result in disqualification from the race and in the most serious circumstances, disqualification from the championship. 
*   Blocking during qualifying is not allowed, please make every effort to keep out of the way when on an outlap or slow down lap
    *   If a dangerous or intentional block occurs please use the protest form in the discord as the stewards won't be alerted that this occurred unless they were viewing it at the time
*   As previously mentioned, the protest form will be made available through the discord
    *   Protests must be made within 5 days of the event
    *   Please provide as much information as you can so the stewards can correctly identify the incident (Lap number, corner) 
*   In the case that a protest occurs, the stewards will attempt to speak to both drivers before finalising their decision. Full explanations will be given in writing over discord.
*   It is completely at the stewards discretion what penalty is applied, please respect the decision
*   An iRacing enforced incident limit of 15x will be in place with their default penalties


### 6.2 Possible Penalties

The following penalties are available to the stewards:



*   Warning
    *   A warning from the stewards with explanation
*   5 seconds added to race time.
    *   This time will be added at the end of the race and championship points will reflect the finishing position after the time is applied. This penalty can be applied at any time before the next event
*   10 seconds added to race time.
    *   This time will be added at the end of the race and championship points will reflect the finishing position after the time is applied. This penalty can be applied at any time before the next event
*   Start from the back of the grid for the next race (qualifying ban)
    *   This will be used primarily for incidents that have to be reviewed after the race or qualifying blocking
    *   The driver is not allowed to set a time during the next events qualifying session. Ignoring this will result in Race disqualification
    *   If a driver receives 4 total warnings, this penalty will be applied and the warnings reset to 0
*   Drive through penalty
    *   The driver must drive into the pitlane, complete the full length of the pitlane without stopping and exit as normal
    *   This must be served within 3 laps of it being applied
*   Round disqualification
    *   This penalty will only be used in the case of refusing to serve a penalty or an obvious intentional contact
    *   The driver will be shown the black flag and the drivers race result will be 0 championship points
    *   This can be applied at any time before the next event
*   Championship disqualification
    *   This will be used in the case of a serious intentional contact. The driver will be removed from the championship and all championship points will be removed
