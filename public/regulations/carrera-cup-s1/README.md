### 5.3 Teams Championship
- There will be no prizes awarded for the winning team, this championship is for merit only
- Each team can only consist of 2 drivers.
 - The 2 drivers must be decided before the start of the first round.
  - If this isn't the case when the series starts then we will assign the two drivers with the most points after round 1

## 6. Protests and Sporting Code
As there is a prize pool, it’s very important that we have clean and fair racing in the championship.

### 6.1 Sporting Rules
- Avoid car contact where possible. All contact incidents involving a car leaving the race track will be reviewed by race stewards either during the event or if missed, afterwards.
 - In the event that the stewards miss the incident, a protest form will be available through the league discord and it will be assessed after the event
- Intentional excessive car contact will have a zero tolerance policy. Incidents such as this will result in disqualification from the race and in the most serious circumstances, disqualification from the championship. 
- As previously mentioned, the protest form will be made available through the discord
 - Protests must be made before the Tuesday after the event at 12:00 UTC
 - Please provide as much information as you can so the stewards can correctly identify the incident (Lap number, corner) 
- In the case that a protest occurs, the stewards will attempt to speak to both drivers before finalising their decision. Full explanations will be given in writing over discord.
- It is completely at the stewards discretion what penalty is applied, please respect the decision
- The following incident limit will be in place for this series
 - First penalty at 20 incident points
 - Penalty every 5 incident points after 20
- If you enter the session with the incorrect car then you will be disqualified from the race

### 6.2 Possible Penalties
The following penalties are examples that the stewards can apply:
- Warning
 - A warning from the stewards with explanation
- Start from the back of the grid for the next event (qualifying ban)
 - This will be used primarily for incidents that have to be reviewed after the race
 - The driver is not allowed to set a time during the next events qualifying session. Ignoring this will result in Race disqualification
 - If a driver receives 3 total warnings, this penalty will be applied and the warnings reset to 0
- Round disqualification
 - This penalty will only be used in the case of refusing to serve a penalty or an obvious intentional contact
 - The driver will be shown the black flag and the drivers race result will be 0 championship points
 - A drop round must still be taken
 - This can be applied at any time before the next event
- Championship disqualification
 - This will be used in the case of a serious intentional contact. The driver will be removed from the championship and all championship points will be removed
